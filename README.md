A clean boilerplate to start creating react apps.

See the original article that this is based off of here: [Setting Up React, Webpack 4 & Babel 7 from scratch — 2019](https://blog.usejournal.com/setting-up-react-webpack-4-babel-7-from-scratch-2019-b771dca2f637) by [Jay Desai](https://blog.usejournal.com/@desaijay315).

This boilerplate also includes a number of customizations for easier developing:

* [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) for DOM bindings for React Router
* [reactstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reactstrap) for Bootstrap 4 components in React
* Customizations for Webpack to read process and read our stylesheets
